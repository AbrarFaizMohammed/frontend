Kwickerhub Website Redesign

## Introduction
This pull request presents a UI/UX redesign of the Kwickerhub website. 
## Design Overview
The Kwickerhub website serves as a drag-and-drop web design tool that helps developers and designers build websites more efficiently and reduce development.

The primary objective of this redesign is to enhance the overall user experience, make it more flexible, professional, and user-friendly. 

Full-screen and immersive:* Developers and designers love to have the entire screen to themselves, so we want our new dashboard to fill the entire browser window.
*Professional and polished:* Our current use of colors on the dashboard page is not very professional, so we're looking for a redesign that will give our dashboard a more polished and sophisticated look.

## Design Process
This involved:
- Using the carried out research overview provided by client, to understand potential user's needs and preferences.     Conducting competitive analysis.
- Wireframing and prototyping to visualize the proposed changes.
- Due to time limitations (there wasn't enough usability testing but additional testing will be conducted as time goes by and the needed iterations will be implemented in the design)

## Design Rationale
The redesign focuses on providing designers with a flexible website layout while enhancing usability and accessibility. The color palette and typography were chosen to ensure a friendly, more professional look.

## Design Assets
Text-Roboto, Space Grotesque, Inter.
Colors: can be seen in local variables of files

## Design Guidelines

## Design Implementation
The technical implementation of this redesign involves changes to the HTML structure and the introduction of new CSS classes to facilitate the design. components and icons that can be exported to SVG, PNG, jpg formats as per needs.
